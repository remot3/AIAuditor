## Description
AI Auditor is an extension for Burp Suite Professional Edition and Burp Suite Enterprise Edition that integrates advanced large language models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Meta to add state-of-the-art AI capabilities to Burp Suite to enhance vulnerability scanning and analysis.

## Features
### Core Capabilities
* **Multi-Provider AI Integration**: **OpenAI** (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o1-preview`, `o1-mini`), **Google Gemini** (`gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`), **Anthropic Claude** (`claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`, `claude-3-opus-latest`), **Ollama** (local models like `llama3`)
* **Detailed Vulnerability Reporting**: Vulnerability description, location, exploitation methods, severity levels (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, `INFORMATIVE`) and confidence levels (`CERTAIN`, `FIRM`, `TENTATIVE`).
* **Custom Instructions**: Tailor the AI’s focus and analysis for special use cases.
* ~~**Context-Aware Analysis**: Configure number of requests/responses analyzed together (`0`—`5`).~~
* **API Key Verification**: Verify API keys instantly within the extension.
* **Integration with Burp Scanner**: Findings are automatically added to Burp’s issue tracker.
* **Persistent Settings**: API keys and custom instructions will be saved and persist across sessions.

## Prerequisites
### For General Usage
* **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
* **API Key**: A valid API key for at least one of the following:
  * [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started)
  * [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini/get_the_api_key) — recommended for newbies since Google offers a relatively generous free tier to use its Gemini API.
  * [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
  * Or a running **Ollama** instance (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`)
* **Burp Suite Professional Edition** or **Burp Suite Enterprise Edition**
  * **NOTE**: Burp Suite Community Edition is currently not supported.

## Installation: Loading JAR in Burp Suite (Recommended)
1. [Download](https://github.com/richeeta/AIAuditor/releases/tag/v1.0.1-pre) the latest version in **[Releases](https://github.com/richeeta/AIAuditor/releases/tag/v1.0.1-pre)**.
2. Open **Burp Suite Professional Edition** or **Burp Suite Enterprise Edition**.
3. Navigate to the **Extensions** tab.
4. Click **Add**, select **Java** as the extension type, and upload the `JAR` file.
5. Click **Next** to load the extension.

## Usage
### Initial Setup
1. Go to the AI Auditor tab in Burp Suite.
2. Enter your API key(s) for OpenAI, Gemini, and/or Claude, then click **Validate** to confirm each key is working. If using Ollama, specify your host and click **Validate** to ensure it's reachable.
3. *Optional*: Add **Custom Instructions** to refine the analysis.
4. Save your settings.

### Analyzing Requests/Responses
#### Single Analysis
1. Right-click a request or response in Burp Suite.
2. Select **Extensions** > **AI Auditor** > **Scan Full Request/Response**.

#### Analyze Selected Portion Only
1. In a request or a response, highlight what you want to scan.
2. Right-click on your highlighted selection.
3. Select **Extensions** > **AI Auditor** > **Scan Selected Portion**.

### Review Results
Findings are displayed in Burp Scanner with detailed information.

## Usage Tips and Recommendations
### Avoid Scanning Large Responses
Large HTTP responses may exceed token limits and result in not only incomplete analysis but also degraded performance.

### Customize Instructions Effectively
To get the best results from the AI Auditor, provide clear and specific instructions. For example:
* **Bad**: `Analyze and report everything that's bad security.`
* **Better**: `Identify and list all API endpoints found in the JavaScript file.`
* **Better**: `Only scan for XSS and SQLi. Do not scan for other issues.`

## FAQ
**Why isn’t Burp Suite Community Edition supported?**

AI Auditor leans heavily on Burp Suite’s Scanner feature, and that’s a perk reserved for the Professional and Enterprise editions. Without it, the extension wouldn’t be able to tie findings neatly into Burp’s issue tracker or play nice with your existing workflows. It’s like trying to cook a gourmet meal on a campfire—it might work, but it won’t be pretty or efficient.

However, I am brainstorming ways to add support for Burp Suite Community Edition in the next release.

**How do I get valid API key(s) to use AI Auditor with my desired OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic model(s)?**

The steps are very easy and straightforward but a little different for each provider:
* **OpenAI (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o1-preview`, `o1-mini`):** Follow OpenAI's [Quickstart guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to sign up and generate your API key.  
* **Google (`gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`):** Follow the instructions on Google's [Gemini API documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini/get_the_api_key) to set up access and retrieve your key.  
* **Anthropic (`claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`, `claude-3-5-haiku-latest`, `claude-3-opus-latest`):** Visit Anthropic's [Getting Started guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started) for detailed steps to acquire an API key.

**VERY IMPORTANT**: While **AI Auditor** itself is free (you're welcome!), you are ultimately responsible for any costs incurred from using the associated APIs. Each provider has its own pricing structure, which you can find in the respective documentation for each.

For the budget-conscious, I'd recommend trying Gemini first, since Google surprisingly offers a generous free tier. (No I don't work for Google.)

**Is this extension available in the BApp Store?**

Not yet—~~but it’s on the way (hopefully)~~! I submitted it to PortSwigger for review on December 2, 2024.

**UPDATE (12/17/24):** PortSwigger has sent me this response:

> Hi Richard,

> Unfortunately, we're still looking into the best way forward to integrate AI/LLM features into extensions in Burp. For now, this means that we are not able to progress your BApp Store extension submission.
> 
> We are investigating different ways to help extension authors integrate this functionality into their extensions safely and securely. When we have further details to share, we'll make sure you're at the top of the list to know.
> Please let us know if you need any further assistance.

**What should I do if I encounter bugs or crashes?**

Please open a new issue. Include as much detail as possible—what you were doing, what went wrong, and any error messages you saw. The more I know, the faster I can fix it. Feedback is invaluable, and I genuinely appreciate users who take the time to report problems.

**Why are false positives or false negatives possible?**

AI models aren’t perfect—they’re probabilistic, not deterministic. This means they rely on patterns, probabilities, and sometimes a little educated guessing. Misinterpretations can happen, especially when instructions or context are vague. To minimize these hiccups, be specific in your instructions and provide clear, relevant data. The better the input, the sharper the output. Still, it’s always a good idea to double-check the findings before acting on them.
